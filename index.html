                        GIIS (Global Indian International School) Bangalore gets the coffee connect with a smile. The Café Coffee Day is a popular brand and when its Value Express outlet was launched in GIIS Bangalore campus, the number of happy faces were infinite. This was the spotlight of the day as students were joyful and eager to know the menu.<br><br>

                        The CCD is a very good initiative within the school premises as students can eat their favourite snacks or savouries while at school. The GIIS staff also felt nice because of the good choices they get to have, even in the midst of their hectic school schedule. <br><br>

                        The choices in the Menu list serve best for breakfast and even quick snacks time. The children of all grades seemed so much familiar with the brand that the very sight of it, made them all excited to grab their share of goodies. This being a Value Express emphasises best quality for the best price. CCD is already making the waves during the break times at GIIS Bangalore!</p>

We are gifted with amazing authors in the world who express the stories in life through their power of expression. GIIS Bangalore believes that the habit of reading books apart from the academic lessons does help develop the creative imagination and vocabulary of the students.<br><br>
                        Right from the inception of the school, the beautiful library facilitated the reading needs of the Pre-Primary and the Primary students through storytelling and many reading activities. As a step further, a new special library in the school premises caters to higher reading with age-appropriate books exclusively for the senior students.

                                    Students were motivated to try unconventional careers as the well-acclaimed Composer, Rapper, Vocalist and DJ, Qaran Mehta, visited the SMART Campus for the GIIS Alumni Talk in September 2018. The IB students had an enriching session with the celebrity who made them believe that it’s never too late to pursue a passion.

                                    An ex-IB student of GIIS, Qaran is now based in Mumbai, India and has got a lot of appreciation for his latest song “Tareefan” in the Hindi film “Veere di Wedding”.

                                    Qaran shared that he developed the love for music after his mother gifted him a Sony Walkman when he was 6-7 years old. During the same time, he also joined the Guitar Lesson but was a horrible student there and started feeling that music was not for him. However, he could not take his mind off the music and kept listening to a lot of Jazz and Chinese songs. Influenced by one of his friends, Qaran began composing beats on his laptop during the school recess hours. He was excited when one of his submitted beats charted in the top 20 of Radio 1 in Dubai. This was the point when Qaran started considering music as a profession apart from passion.
